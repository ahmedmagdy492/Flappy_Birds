# Flappy Bird Clone

- this game is made only in 2 days
- created using C++ and Raylib
- this time i am using a single texture and a texture atlas to render all of the objects images
- sound effects
- bird jumping is not the same as the original game it needed some physics concepts such as forces which i am not good at, so i decided to keep it simple and use a simple mechanism to handle the jumping
