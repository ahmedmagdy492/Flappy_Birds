# Flappy Bird Clone

- this game is made only in 2 days
- created using C++ and Raylib
- this time i am using a single texture and a texture atlas to render all of the objects images
- sound effects
- enhanced bird jumping to be as much as possible as the real flappy bird game except for the rotation
- added the real flappy bird font
- added the bird fly animation
